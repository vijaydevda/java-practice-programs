**Native memory** refers to memory allocated **outside** the Java heap, directly managed by the **operating system**, rather than the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Unlike heap memory, which stores Java objects and is controlled by the garbage collector, native memory is used for system-level operations.

### **How Native Memory Is Used in Java**
1. **Metaspace (Java 8+):**
   - Stores **class metadata**, replacing PermGen.
   - Avoids Java heap constraints, dynamically expanding as needed.

2. **Direct Buffers:**
   - Used for high-performance **I/O operations** (e.g., NIO `ByteBuffer`).
   - Helps bypass Java heap for faster data transfer.

3. **JNI (Java Native Interface):**
   - Allows Java to call native code (C/C++).
   - Uses native memory for interoperability with external libraries.

4. **Thread Stacks:**
   - Each Java thread gets a native **stack** for method execution.
   - Includes method call frames, local variables, and return addresses.

### **Key Difference: Heap vs. Native Memory**
| **Aspect** | **Java Heap** | **Native Memory** |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Managed By** | JVM (Garbage Collector) | OS (Memory Allocator) |
| **Used For** | Java objects (Strings, Arrays, etc.) | Class metadata, native libraries, direct buffers |
| **Resizing** | Limited by JVM settings | More flexible, often dynamically allocated |
| **Performance** | Affected by GC cycles | Faster access, avoids GC overhead |

For Java performance optimization, **understanding native memory usage is crucial**, especially if you're working with **high-scale applications or JNI-based integrations**. Since you're refining your **Java expertise**, diving into native memory concepts can be a great way to expand your knowledge!
