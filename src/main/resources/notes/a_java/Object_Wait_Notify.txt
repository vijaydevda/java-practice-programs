Excellent question ‚Äî this often confuses even experienced developers. The reason `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` are part of the **`Object` class** (and not `Thread`, `Runnable`, or any concurrency-specific class) comes down to **how Java's intrinsic locks and thread coordination are designed to work at the object level**.

---

### üîç **Why are `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()` in `Object` and not `Thread`?**

#### 1. **Every object in Java can be a monitor**

* In Java, **every object** has an **intrinsic lock (monitor)**.
* Synchronization in Java is done on **objects**, not on threads:

  ```java
  synchronized(myObject) {
      // thread acquires myObject's lock
  }
  ```
* Since thread coordination (`wait/notify`) relies on the **monitor of an object**, these methods are tied to **objects**, not threads.

#### 2. **Thread communication happens via shared objects**

* Threads don‚Äôt signal each other directly; they communicate via shared objects.
* Example:

  ```java
  synchronized (sharedQueue) {
      sharedQueue.wait();      // Wait on the object's monitor
  }

  synchronized (sharedQueue) {
      sharedQueue.notify();    // Notify a thread waiting on the same object
  }
  ```

#### 3. **Design intent: Wait on the resource, not the thread**

* A thread waiting on `obj.wait()` is saying: **‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for a condition related to `obj` to change.‚Äù**
* Not: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for another thread to do something.‚Äù (That's a different pattern.)

### ü§î But... not all objects are used for multithreading?

You're right ‚Äî **most objects won‚Äôt be involved in synchronization**, and that‚Äôs fine. But since **any object *can* be**, `wait()`/`notify()` need to be available universally.

Including them in a special interface like `Runnable` or `Thread` would **limit this capability only to certain classes**, which:

* Would break the flexible synchronization model,
* Would make synchronized blocks (`synchronized(obj)`) less meaningful for non-Thread types,
* Would introduce complexity in allowing arbitrary objects to become coordination points.

### üîÑ Analogy

Think of **locks as being attached to doors (objects)**, not to the people (threads) passing through them.

So:

* `wait()` = the person **waits near the door**,
* `notify()` = another person **knocks on the door** to signal,
* Since **doors (objects)** are where the waiting happens, the methods logically belong to **the object**, not the person.
