### 🔹 What is `ForkJoinPool` in Java?

`ForkJoinPool` is a **specialized thread pool** introduced in **Java 7** (in `java.util.concurrent`) designed to **efficiently execute tasks that can be broken into smaller subtasks** — following the **divide-and-conquer** paradigm.

It powers features like:

* **Parallel Streams**
* **`CompletableFuture`**
* **RecursiveTask** and **RecursiveAction**

---

### ✅ Core Idea

It uses a technique called **work stealing**:

* Idle threads **"steal" tasks** from busy threads' queues.
* This improves **CPU utilization** and reduces idle time.

### ✅ Key Components

| Component            | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work Stealing**    | Each worker thread has its own queue. If it's idle, it tries to steal tasks from others. |
| **RecursiveTask<T>** | For tasks that return a result                                                           |
| **RecursiveAction**  | For tasks that don't return a result                                                     |
| **Common Pool**      | A shared ForkJoinPool used by parallel streams and `CompletableFuture` by default        |

### ✅ Basic Example: RecursiveTask

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    int[] arr;
    int start, end;

    SumTask(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= 2) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) sum += arr[i];
            return sum;
        }

        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        SumTask left = new SumTask(arr, start, mid);
        SumTask right = new SumTask(arr, mid, end);

        left.fork(); // run asynchronously
        int rightResult = right.compute(); // compute right in current thread
        int leftResult = left.join(); // wait for left to finish

        return leftResult + rightResult;
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        SumTask task = new SumTask(arr, 0, arr.length);
        int result = pool.invoke(task);
        System.out.println("Sum = " + result); // Output: Sum = 21
    }
}
```

### ✅ ForkJoinPool vs ThreadPoolExecutor

| Feature       | ForkJoinPool                          | ThreadPoolExecutor         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Task Type     | Recursive, fork/join                  | Independent, long-running  |
| Work Stealing | Yes                                   | No                         |
| Efficiency    | Higher for fine-grained parallelism   | Good for traditional tasks |
| Used in       | `parallelStream`, `CompletableFuture` | Web servers, executors     |

---

### ✅ Common Pool

You can access the shared pool like this:

```java
ForkJoinPool commonPool = ForkJoinPool.commonPool();
```

Default size: `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`

You can also **create custom pools** if you want isolated resources.

---

### ⚠️ Caution in Web Apps / Spring Boot

* Since `parallelStream()` and `CompletableFuture` use the **common pool**, uncontrolled usage can lead to **thread starvation**.
* For production-grade apps, especially in **web environments**, consider using **custom thread pools** to avoid contention.

---

### ✅ Summary

* `ForkJoinPool` efficiently handles **recursive, parallelizable tasks**.
* Based on **divide-and-conquer** and **work-stealing**.
* Powers **parallel streams** and **async APIs** like `CompletableFuture`.
* Best suited for **CPU-intensive**, **short-lived**, and **splittable** tasks.
