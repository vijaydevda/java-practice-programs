The **JVM Memory Model** (also called the **Runtime Data Areas**) defines **how the Java Virtual Machine allocates and manages memory during program execution**.

It lays out the **structure of memory** that the JVM uses for:

- Loading classes
    
- Creating objects
    
- Running methods
    
- Managing threads
    
- Performing garbage collection

## 🧱 Components of the JVM Memory Model

Below is a detailed breakdown:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         JVM MEMORY MODEL (Runtime)         │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Method Area (part of Metaspace)        │
│  2. Heap                                   │
│  3. Java Stack (per thread)                │
│  4. Program Counter Register (per thread)  │
│  5. Native Method Stack (per thread)       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### 1. 🧾 **Method Area (MetaSpace from Java 8+)**

- **Stores**: Class metadata, static variables, constant pool.
    
- **Shared** among all threads.
    
- In Java 8+, replaced by **Metaspace** (which uses native memory, not heap).
    
- Managed by JVM class loader.
    

📌 Example: When you load a class `Employee`, its bytecode, method definitions, and static fields go here.

---

### 2. 🛢️ **Heap**

- **Stores**: All **objects and their instance variables**.
    
- Shared among all threads.
    
- Managed by **Garbage Collector (GC)**.
    
- Divided internally into:
    
    - **Young Generation** (eden + survivor spaces)
        
    - **Old Generation** (tenured space)
        

📌 Example: `new Employee()` allocates memory on the heap.

### 3. 🧮 **Java Stack (Thread Stack)**

- **Each thread has its own stack**.
    
- Stores:
    
    - Method call frames
        
    - Local variables
        
    - Operand stack (used for calculations)
        
    - Return addresses
        
- **LIFO** structure (Last-In, First-Out).
    
- Automatically cleaned up when method execution ends.
    

📌 Example: In `int sum(int a, int b)`, variables `a` and `b` are stored in the thread’s stack.

---

### 4. 🎯 **Program Counter (PC) Register**

- Each thread has its own PC.
    
- Holds the **address of the current bytecode instruction** being executed.
    
- Helps with **thread switching and execution tracking**.
    

📌 Think of it as a pointer showing "what to execute next" for each thread.

---

### 5. 🧬 **Native Method Stack**

- Used when Java calls **native (non-Java) methods** via JNI (Java Native Interface).
    
- Similar to the Java stack but for **native languages like C/C++**.
    

📌 Example: Calling an OS-level function written in C.

## 🔄 Lifecycle of JVM Memory Areas

|Memory Area|Created On|Destroyed On|
|---|---|---|
|Method Area|JVM startup|JVM shutdown|
|Heap|JVM startup|JVM shutdown|
|Java Stack|Thread creation|Thread termination|
|PC Register|Thread creation|Thread termination|
|Native Stack|Thread creation|Thread termination|

---

## 🧹 Garbage Collection (GC) in JVM

- Automatically removes unreachable objects from the **Heap**.
    
- **Generational GC**: Objects are divided by age:
    
    - **Young Gen**: Short-lived objects
        
    - **Old Gen**: Long-lived objects
        
- Helps optimize memory and improve performance.

## 📊 Summary Table

|Memory Area|Thread Shared|Stores|Managed By|
|---|---|---|---|
|Method Area|Yes|Class metadata, static vars|JVM class loader|
|Heap|Yes|Objects|Garbage Collector|
|Java Stack|No|Method frames, local vars|JVM (per thread)|
|PC Register|No|Current bytecode address|JVM (per thread)|
|Native Method Stack|No|Native method frames|JVM / Native OS|

## ✅ Real-Life Analogy

Imagine JVM as a company:

- **Heap** = Warehouse (where all product objects live)
    
- **Method Area** = Knowledge base (class definitions)
    
- **Java Stack** = Employee’s desk (each thread’s workspace)
    
- **PC Register** = Task pointer (what task the employee is doing)
    
- **Native Stack** = External consultant desk (for foreign/native tools)
