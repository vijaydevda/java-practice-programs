The **Java Memory Model (JMM)** defines **how Java programs interact with memory**, especially in the context of **multithreading and concurrency**. It specifies how variables are stored, read, and updated in memory, ensuring **visibility, ordering, and atomicity** across threads.

## 🧠 Java Memory Model (JMM) — Overview

The JMM is part of the Java Language Specification and was revised in **Java 5** to address concurrency more precisely.

## 🧱 Memory Structure in Java

Here’s the **basic memory structure** in a typical Java application:

```
            JVM Memory
            ┌────────────────────────────┐
            │        Method Area         │ ← class metadata, static vars, constants
            ├────────────────────────────┤
            │        Heap Area           │ ← objects, instance vars
            ├────────────────────────────┤
            │       Stack (per thread)   │ ← local variables, method frames
            ├────────────────────────────┤
            │  Program Counter (per thread) │ ← current instruction address
            ├────────────────────────────┤
            │      Native Method Stacks │ ← for JNI/native methods
            └────────────────────────────┘
```

But the **Java Memory Model (JMM)** is more focused on:

### ✅ **How variables are read/written in multi-threaded environments.**

---

## 🔁 Main Concepts of JMM

### 1. **Main Memory vs Working Memory**

- **Main Memory** = Shared heap memory visible to all threads.
    
- **Working Memory** = Each thread’s **private cache** of variables (like CPU registers or thread-local copies).
    

🔁 A thread does **not always** read/write directly to main memory—it may work on a cached copy.

---

### 2. **Happens-Before Relationship**

- A crucial rule to **define visibility and ordering**.
    
- If **A "happens-before" B**, then:
    
    - A’s effects (writes) are visible to B.
        
    - B is guaranteed to see the result of A.
        

#### Examples:

- Writing to a variable before reading it in the same thread.
    
- A call to `Thread.start()` **happens-before** the started thread runs.
    
- A call to `Thread.join()` **happens-before** the main thread resumes.
    

---

### 3. **Volatile Keyword**

- Guarantees **visibility**, not atomicity.
    
- When a variable is declared `volatile`, all reads and writes go **directly to/from main memory**.
    
- It ensures:
    
    - All threads see the latest value.
        
    - Prevents reordering of instructions around the volatile variable.
        

---

### 4. **Synchronized Keyword**

- Ensures both **mutual exclusion (locking)** and **visibility**.
    
- The exit of a `synchronized` block **flushes changes** to main memory.
    
- The entry of another thread into the block **reloads values** from main memory.
    

---

### 5. **Final Fields**

- After an object’s constructor finishes, **final fields become visible** to all threads (if the object is correctly published).
    

---

## 🚦 Memory Visibility Issues (Without JMM Rules)

Example:

```java
boolean flag = false;

Thread writer = () -> {
    flag = true; // write to flag
};

Thread reader = () -> {
    while (!flag) {
        // may loop forever if thread reads from its local cache
    }
};
```

⚠️ **Without `volatile`, the reader thread may not see the updated value**, due to caching.

---

## 🔐 Summary Table

|Feature|Guarantees|Used For|
|---|---|---|
|`volatile`|Visibility|Simple flags or state variables|
|`synchronized`|Visibility + Atomicity|Critical sections / shared data|
|`final`|Visibility after constructor|Immutable objects|

---

## 📌 In Practice

- Use **`synchronized` or `ReentrantLock`** for atomic operations.
    
- Use **`volatile`** for status flags (like `isRunning`, `shutdown`, etc.).
    
- Understand **happens-before** rules for writing correct concurrent code.
